# Competitive-Programming
This repo contains my solutions to competitive programming challenges, from various online judges/contest sites .
## Setup
Actually the setup doesn't matter , but i want to share mine maybe it can help someone :

**OS :** I use a linux based os (Kali Linux) .\
**IDE :** I use  [geany](https://github.com/geany/geany) to write and compile c++ code (it's simple and very lightwheight) .\
**Debugger  :** [gdbgui](https://github.com/cs01/gdbgui) it's a browser-based frontend to [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) .

## Notes  
- All the code above is fully written by me .
- All the solutions are submitted and accepted .
- My solutions may not be the best in time/space complexity terms .
- Some Solutions may have been written in a rush during a contest and may not be written in a clean way .

If u have a better solution , feel free to create a new issue .
